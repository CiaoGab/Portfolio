              I'm a self-taught Front-End Developer with a strong passion for learning and building user-focused experiences. I've become proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React through dedicated study and hands-on practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have over 8 years of experience in operations management and customer success, where I developed strong skills in project management, cross-functional collaboration, and relationship-building. These experiences have shaped my approach to developmentâ€”ensuring I create solutions that are not only functional but also aligned with user and business needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              What began as a hobby quickly grew into a true passion. Today, front-end development is where I channel my curiosity, creativity, and drive. I bring enthusiasm and commitment to every project, always striving to learn more and improve with each iteration.
